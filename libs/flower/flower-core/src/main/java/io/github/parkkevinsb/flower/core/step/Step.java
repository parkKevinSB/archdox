/**
 * Base class users extend to define an orchestration unit.
 *
 * <p>A Step is stateful and tied to one Flow instance. The framework calls
 * the lifecycle hooks below in order; the user implements
 * {@link #onTick(StepContext)} and overrides the others as needed.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   onEnter(ctx)            // called once when the Step becomes current
 *   onTick(ctx) repeatedly  // called every Worker tick until it returns
 *                           // DONE / GOTO / FINISH / FAIL / REPEAT
 *   onExit(ctx)             // called once when the Step is leaving (done/goto/finish/fail)
 *   onReset(ctx)            // called when the Step is being reset (repeat)
 *                           // followed by onEnter on the next tick
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Steps are <em>not</em> instantiated by reflection. Users construct them
 * directly inside a {@code FlowFactory} and pass dependencies through the
 * constructor.
 *
 * <p>Step is meant to be a thin orchestration class. Heavy domain logic,
 * DB access, protocol encoding, and external API calls belong in services
 * the Step calls into - not inside the Step itself.
